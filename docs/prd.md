## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* **Simplicity**: Provide a user experience where a video can be converted with a minimum number of taps on mobile.
* **Efficiency**: Create a high-quality, web-optimized MP4 that is significantly smaller than the source file using mobile device processing power.
* **Satisfaction**: Achieve high user satisfaction by being a reliable, easy-to-use mobile tool for its single purpose.
* **Portability**: Deliver the application as a single `.apk` file that can be installed on Android devices without requiring Google Play Store distribution.
* **Offline Operation**: Ensure the app works completely offline without requiring internet connectivity for video processing.

### Background Context

Many mobile users need a simple tool to convert video files for web use, social media sharing, or storage optimization without relying on cloud services or complex mobile apps. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a focused Android mobile application that does one thing well: it converts any video file into a web-optimized MP4 using the device's own processing power. The project will leverage React Native or Flutter framework to achieve cross-platform compatibility with native performance.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1**: The user must be able to select a video file from their device's gallery, camera roll, or file system.
2.  **FR2**: The application must convert the selected video into a web-optimized MP4 file using only device processing power (no cloud processing).
3.  **FR3**: The application must provide a real-time visual indicator of the conversion progress with estimated time remaining.
4.  **FR4**: Upon successful conversion, the file is saved to the device's gallery or a designated app folder with user confirmation.
5.  **FR5**: The application must contain an "About" section accessible through settings, displaying information about the developer and app version.
6.  **FR6**: The user must be able to cancel a conversion that is in progress. The application should safely terminate the process and clean up temporary files.
7.  **FR7**: The app must handle device rotation and maintain conversion state during orientation changes.
8.  **FR8**: The app must manage device resources efficiently to prevent overheating and battery drain during conversion.

### Non-Functional

1.  **NFR1**: The user interface must be clean, simple, and follow Material Design guidelines for Android.
2.  **NFR2**: The application must be built using React Native or Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility.
3.  **NFR3**: The final application must be distributed as a single `.apk` file that can be sideloaded without Google Play Store.
4.  **NFR4**: The video conversion process must produce optimal quality while being mindful of mobile device processing limitations.
5.  **NFR5**: The app must work entirely offline without requiring internet connectivity.
6.  **NFR6**: The app must request only necessary permissions (storage, camera access if needed).
7.  **NFR7**: The app must be compatible with Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above.
8.  **NFR8**: The app must handle low storage scenarios gracefully with appropriate user warnings.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The application should be minimalist, touch-friendly, and intuitive for mobile users. The interface should be optimized for one-handed use where possible. The entire user journey should be smooth and require minimal interactions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Conversion**: A single, prominent button initiates conversion with clear visual feedback.
* **Mobile-First**: All interactions designed for touch interface with appropriate touch targets (minimum 44dp).

### Core Screens and Views
1. **Main Screen**: Single primary screen with file selection, conversion controls, and progress display
2. **Settings Screen**: Simple settings including output quality options and about information
3. **Results Screen**: Post-conversion summary with options to share, save, or convert another file

### Accessibility
* **Target**: Android Accessibility Guidelines. Support for TalkBack, large text, and high contrast modes.
* **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements minimum 48dp as per Material Design guidelines.

### Branding
* The application will have a clean, modern Material Design aesthetic suitable for Android ecosystem.

### Target Device and Platforms

* **Architecture**: ARM64 and ARM32 support
* **Screen Sizes**: Phone and tablet layouts (responsive design)

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
* **Monorepo**: A single repository for the self-contained mobile application.

### Service Architecture
* **Monolith**: Single mobile application with all processing done locally on device.
* **Offline-First**: No server dependencies or cloud processing.

### Testing Requirements
* **Unit + Integration + Device Testing**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and real device testing across various Android versions and hardware configurations.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* The application **must** be built using **React Native** or **Flutter** framework for efficient mobile development.
