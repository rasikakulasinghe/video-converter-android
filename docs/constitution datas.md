# Video Converter - React Native Android App Constitution

## Preamble

This constitution serves as the foundational document governing the development, architecture, and maintenance of the Video Converter Android application. Built with React Native, this app leverages on-device processing power to provide offline video conversion capabilities while maintaining exceptional performance, user experience, and code quality standards.

## Core Principles

### I. Component-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Atomic Design Philosophy**: Components must follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component serves one clear purpose with a focused API
- **Reusability First**: All UI elements must be designed as reusable components with configurable props
- **Self-Containment**: Components must encapsulate their own logic, styles, and dependencies
- **Prop Interface Clarity**: Clear TypeScript interfaces for all component props with comprehensive documentation

### II. Architectural Foundation

### III. Design System & Visual Identity
- **Color Palette**: Strict adherence to the defined color system
  - Primary Blue: `#2f6690` - Main navigation and primary actions
  - Secondary Blue: `#3a7ca5` - Secondary buttons and highlights  
  - Light Gray: `#d9dcd6` - Background surfaces and subtle elements
  - Dark Blue: `#16425b` - Headers, important text, and emphasis
