- Foreground notification appears when app is minimized
- Device thermal management prevents overheating
- Conversion continues through orientation changes

**Validation Steps**:
```
✅ Progress bar updates smoothly (every 1-2 seconds)
✅ Percentage and time estimates display
✅ Device temperature remains comfortable to touch
✅ App responds to orientation changes without interrupting conversion
✅ Background notification shows progress when app minimized
✅ Conversion completes successfully
✅ Memory usage stays within reasonable limits
```

**Progress Monitoring**:
- Progress should advance steadily from 0% to 100%
- Time estimates should become more accurate as conversion proceeds
- No app freezing or unresponsive behavior
- Ability to cancel conversion at any time

### 5. Conversion Results

**User Actions**:
1. Review conversion completion notification
2. Examine converted video details
3. Test playback of converted video
4. Choose post-conversion action:
   - Save to Gallery
   - Share to another app
   - Convert another video
   - View before/after comparison

**Expected Behavior**:
- Success notification with conversion summary
- Converted video details displayed (new file size, compression ratio)
- Quick preview/playback functionality
- Clear options for next actions

**Validation Steps**:
```
✅ Conversion completion notification appears
✅ Output file size significantly smaller than input (30-70% reduction typical)
✅ Converted video plays successfully in device media player
✅ Video quality acceptable for intended use (web/social media)
✅ File saved to chosen location (Gallery or App folder)
✅ Share functionality works with other apps
✅ Original video remains unchanged
```

**Quality Assessment**:
- **Visual Quality**: Should be acceptable for web use, social media sharing

- **Battery Impact**: Moderate usage, should complete on 50%+ battery
- **Storage Efficiency**: 30-70% file size reduction typical
- **App Launch Time**: < 2 seconds from tap to usable interface

### Device Compatibility Testing

**Test on Different Device Classes**:
- **High-End**: Flagship phones (2-3 years old maximum)
- **Mid-Range**: Popular mid-tier Android devices
- **Budget**: Entry-level devices with minimum specifications

**Performance Scaling**:
- High-end devices: Faster conversion, higher quality options
- Mid-range devices: Balanced performance and quality

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Problems
- **"App not installed"**: Check device storage, enable unknown sources
- **"Parse error"**: Download APK again, ensure file isn't corrupted

### Permission Issues
- **Can't access videos**: Grant storage permissions in Settings
