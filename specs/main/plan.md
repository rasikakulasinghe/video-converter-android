## Summary
Mobile Video Converter is an offline Android application that converts video files to web-optimized MP4 format using device processing power. The app features a touch-optimized Material Design UI with real-time progress tracking, device resource management, and APK distribution capabilities. Technical approach leverages React Native with TypeScript, FFmpeg Kit for video processing, and component-driven architecture following atomic design principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: React Native 0.73+ with TypeScript 5.0+ (strict configuration)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FFmpeg Kit React Native, React Navigation v6, NativeWind (Tailwind CSS), React Native File System (RNFS)  
**Storage**: Local device storage with file system operations (no external database)  
**Testing**: Jest unit tests, React Native Testing Library, integration tests with real video files  
**Target Platform**: Android 8.0+ (API level 26), ARM64 and ARM32 architectures  
**Project Type**: Mobile - Single Android application with offline video processing  
**Performance Goals**: App launch < 2 seconds, memory usage < 200MB baseline, efficient video conversion  
**Constraints**: Offline operation only, device thermal management, battery optimization, APK distribution  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-purpose mobile app, 3 core screens, comprehensive video format support

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Component-Driven Development ✅

### III. Test-Coverage ✅
- ✅ Jest unit tests and React Native Testing Library component tests
- ✅ Minimum 80% code coverage for utilities and services
- ✅ TDD approach: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement
- ✅ Performance tests for video processing workflows

### IV. Integration Testing ✅
- ✅ Video conversion end-to-end workflows testing planned
- ✅ File system operations testing with real video files
- ✅ Background processing and component interaction testing
- ✅ Test dataset snapshots for repeatable testing

### V. Architecture & Performance Standards ✅
- ✅ Atomic design folder structure
- ✅ FFmpeg Kit integration with chunked processing and memory management
- ✅ Background processing with real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Performance targets: App launch < 2 seconds, memory < 200MB

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 (Mobile Application) - React Native Android app with offline video processing capabilities

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Completed:
1. **FFmpeg Kit React Native Integration**
   - Decision: Use FFmpeg Kit React Native for video processing
   - Rationale: Provides comprehensive video processing with mobile optimization, supports hardware acceleration
   - Alternatives considered: Native Android MediaMetadataRetriever (limited formats), ExoPlayer (playback focused)

2. **Device Resource Management Patterns**
   - Decision: Implement thermal monitoring with React Native Device Info + native thermal throttling
   - Rationale: Prevents device overheating during intensive video processing
   - Alternatives considered: No monitoring (risky), basic battery monitoring only (insufficient)

3. **Background Processing Architecture**
   - Decision: Use React Native Background Job with foreground service notifications
   - Rationale: Ensures conversion continues when app is minimized, provides user feedback
   - Alternatives considered: Foreground only (poor UX), WorkManager (complex setup)

4. **File System Operations**
   - Decision: React Native File System (RNFS) for cross-platform file operations
   - Rationale: Comprehensive file system API with Android Media Store integration
   - Alternatives considered: Native modules only (platform-specific), Expo FileSystem (limited capabilities)

5. **State Management for Conversion Progress**
   - Decision: Zustand for lightweight state management with persistence
   - Rationale: Simple, TypeScript-friendly, perfect for single-purpose app state
   - Alternatives considered: Redux (overkill), React Context (performance concerns), AsyncStorage only (no reactive updates)

**Output**: ✅ research.md completed with all technical unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Entities:
1. **VideoFile**: Source and converted video files with metadata
2. **ConversionJob**: Active/completed conversion processes with progress tracking
3. **AppSettings**: User preferences and configuration
4. **DeviceResources**: System monitoring data

### API Contracts:
Since this is an offline mobile app, "contracts" refer to internal service interfaces:
- **VideoProcessorService**: Video conversion operations
- **FileManagerService**: File system operations
- **DeviceMonitorService**: Resource monitoring
- **SettingsService**: User preferences management

### Test Scenarios:
- End-to-end video conversion workflow
- Device resource management during processing
- File system operations and storage management
- UI state management during conversion

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md completed

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (service contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each service interface → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → TypeScript model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Component implementation tasks following atomic design hierarchy
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Types/Models → Services → Components → Screens → Navigation
- Atomic design order: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Screens
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Project setup and configuration (5 tasks)
- Data models and types (5 tasks)  
- Service layer implementation (8 tasks)
- Component library (12 tasks)
- Screen implementations (6 tasks)
- Integration and testing (5 tasks)
- APK build and distribution (4 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - all requirements align with established principles*

No entries required - the mobile video converter implementation follows all constitutional requirements without needing complexity justifications.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
