# Phase 0 Research: Mobile Video Converter Android App

**Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Feature**: Mobile Video Converter Android App  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for all technical unknowns identified during the planning phase of the Mobile Video Converter Android application.

## 1. FFmpeg Kit React Native Integration

### Decision
Use **FFmpeg Kit React Native** (version 5.1+) for video processing operations

### Rationale
- **Mobile Optimization**: Specifically designed for React Native with mobile performance optimizations
- **Comprehensive Format Support**: Handles all major video formats commonly found on mobile devices
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Supports Android hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding when available
- **Memory Management**: Built-in memory management prevents OOM crashes during processing
- **Active Maintenance**: Well-maintained library with regular updates and React Native compatibility
- **Offline Processing**: Pure native processing without cloud dependencies

### Alternatives Considered
- **Native Android MediaMetadataRetriever**: Limited to basic operations, poor format support
- **ExoPlayer**: Focused on playback, not conversion, requires complex custom implementation
- **Native FFmpeg**: Requires extensive native module development and maintenance burden
- **Cloud Services**: Against offline-first requirement

### Implementation Notes
- Use `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` package
- Configure with `min` package for smaller APK size
- Implement chunked processing for large video files
- Add progress callbacks for real-time UI updates

## 2. Device Resource Management Patterns

### Decision
Implement comprehensive device monitoring using **React Native Device Info** combined with **native thermal management**

### Rationale
- **Thermal Protection**: Prevents device overheating during intensive video processing
- **Battery Optimization**: Monitors battery level and adjusts processing intensity
- **Memory Management**: Tracks available memory to prevent crashes
- **User Experience**: Provides transparent feedback about device limitations
- **Android Guidelines**: Follows Android's best practices for resource-intensive apps

### Alternatives Considered
- **No Monitoring**: Risky approach that could damage devices or cause crashes
- **Basic Battery Only**: Insufficient for thermal management during video processing
- **Manual Implementation**: Complex and error-prone compared to established libraries

### Implementation Notes
- Monitor CPU temperature and throttle processing above 70°C
- Reduce processing speed when battery < 20%
- Pause processing if available memory < 100MB
- Show user warnings and allow manual override with disclaimers

## 3. Background Processing Architecture

### Decision
Use **React Native Background Job** with **Android Foreground Services** and notification management

### Rationale
- **Uninterrupted Processing**: Conversion continues when app is minimized
- **User Awareness**: Persistent notifications keep users informed of progress
- **System Integration**: Proper Android service lifecycle management
- **Cancellation Support**: Users can stop processing from notification
- **Battery Optimization**: Respects Android's background processing limitations

### Alternatives Considered
- **Foreground Only**: Poor user experience, processing stops when app is minimized
- **WorkManager**: Overkill for real-time progress tracking, less control over execution
- **Headless JS**: Limited execution time, not suitable for long video processing

### Implementation Notes
- Register foreground service in AndroidManifest.xml
- Implement proper service lifecycle (start, update, stop)
- Use notification channels for Android 8.0+ compatibility
- Handle service interruptions gracefully

## 4. File System Operations

### Decision
Use **React Native File System (RNFS)** for comprehensive file operations with **Android Media Store integration**

### Rationale
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent API across platforms if future iOS support needed
- **Media Store Integration**: Proper Android gallery integration for saved videos
- **Permission Management**: Handles scoped storage and runtime permissions
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile file operations
- **Documentation**: Well-documented with extensive React Native community support

### Alternatives Considered
- **Native Modules Only**: Platform-specific development, increased maintenance
- **Expo FileSystem**: Limited capabilities, not suitable for complex file operations
- **Direct Android APIs**: Requires extensive native module development

### Implementation Notes
- Request WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions
- Use MediaStore for gallery integration on Android 10+
- Implement proper scoped storage for Android 11+ compatibility
- Add file validation and corruption detection

## 5. State Management for Conversion Progress

### Decision
Use **Zustand** for lightweight state management with **AsyncStorage persistence**

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders, efficient updates
- **Persistence**: Built-in persistence middleware for settings and progress
- **Size**: Small bundle size perfect for single-purpose app
- **React Native Optimized**: Works seamlessly with React Native's architecture

### Alternatives Considered
- **Redux Toolkit**: Overkill for simple app state, larger bundle size
- **React Context**: Performance concerns with frequent progress updates
- **AsyncStorage Only**: No reactive updates, poor developer experience
- **Jotai**: More complex than needed for this use case

### Implementation Notes
- Create separate stores for: conversion state, app settings, device resources
- Implement persistence middleware for user preferences
- Use subscriptions for real-time progress updates
- Add state hydration on app startup

## 6. UI Component Architecture

### Decision
Implement **Atomic Design** with **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native)

### Rationale
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Aligns with component-driven development requirements
- **Scalability**: Clear hierarchy from atoms to organisms to templates
- **Consistency**: Shared design system across all components
- **Performance**: Compile-time CSS with minimal runtime overhead
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for styling
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar Tailwind syntax with IntelliSense support

### Alternatives Considered
- **Styled Components**: Runtime styling overhead, larger bundle size
- **StyleSheet API**: Verbose syntax, no design system integration
- **Tamagui**: Complex setup for simple app requirements

### Implementation Notes
- Structure: atoms (buttons, icons) → molecules (forms, cards) → organisms (screens)
- Use design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Implement dark mode support through Tailwind configuration
- Add accessibility classes for WCAG compliance

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Decision
Comprehensive testing with **Jest**, **React Native Testing Library**, and **Detox** for E2E testing

### Rationale
- **Constitutional Requirement**: Minimum 80% code coverage mandate
- **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation
- **Real Device Testing**: Video processing requires actual device testing
- **Performance Validation**: Test conversion times across device spectrum
- **Integration Coverage**: End-to-end video conversion workflows

### Alternatives Considered
- **Enzyme**: Deprecated, poor React Native support
- **Appium**: Complex setup, less React Native-specific features
- **Manual Testing Only**: Against constitutional testing requirements

### Implementation Notes
- Unit tests for services and utilities (80% coverage minimum)
- Component tests with React Native Testing Library
- Integration tests with real video files and device scenarios
- Performance tests for memory usage and conversion times
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
