# Tasks: Mobile Video Converter Android App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/main/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Loaded: React Native 0.73+, TypeScript 5.0+, FFmpeg Kit, NativeWind
   → ✅ Structure: Mobile app with atomic design components
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities (VideoFile, ConversionJob, AppSettings, DeviceResources)
   → contracts/: 4 service interfaces (VideoProcessor, FileManager, DeviceMonitor, Settings)
   → research.md: Technical decisions for FFmpeg, state management, UI architecture
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: React Native project, dependencies, TypeScript configuration
   → Tests: Service contract tests, integration tests for user scenarios
   → Core: TypeScript models, service implementations, component library
   → Integration: FFmpeg integration, device monitoring, file system operations
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance validation, APK build
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T045)
6. Generate dependency graph for React Native mobile app
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: All services have contracts and tests
9. Return: SUCCESS (45 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Mobile application structure:
- **React Native source**: `src/` at repository root
- **Android native**: `android/` for native Android configuration
- **Tests**: `tests/` with subdirectories for different test types
- **Configuration**: Root level config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Service Contracts**:
   - 4 service interfaces → 4 contract test tasks [P] (T014-T017)
   - 4 service interfaces → 4 implementation tasks [P] (T027-T030)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 4 entities → 4 model test tasks [P] (T010-T013)
   - 4 entities → 4 model implementation tasks [P] (T022-T025)

3. **From User Stories/Quickstart**:
   - 4 main scenarios → 4 integration tests [P] (T018-T021)
   - 3 core screens → 3 screen implementation tasks (T041-T043)

4. **From Constitutional Requirements**:
   - Atomic design → Component library tasks (T035-T040)
   - TDD approach → Tests before implementation ordering
   - 80% coverage → Unit test tasks (T046)
   - Performance standards → Performance test tasks (T045)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All service contracts have corresponding tests (T014-T017)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T022-T025)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD ordering enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitutional requirements addressed (atomic design, TypeScript strict, TDD)
- [x] Mobile-specific requirements included (Android config, React Native setup)
- [x] Performance and integration testing covered
- [x] APK build and distribution preparation included

## Notes

- **Critical TDD Flow**: Tests T010-T021 must be completed and failing before any implementation tasks T022-T048
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All tasks follow component-driven development, TypeScript excellence, and test coverage requirements
- **Mobile-Specific**: Tasks include React Native configuration, Android setup, and mobile performance considerations
- **Atomic Design**: Component tasks follow atoms → molecules → organisms → templates hierarchy
- **Performance**: Memory usage (<200MB), app launch time (<2s), and conversion efficiency are tested
- **Offline-First**: All tasks support offline video processing without cloud dependencies

This task list provides a comprehensive, dependency-ordered implementation plan for the Mobile Video Converter Android app, ensuring constitutional compliance and mobile best practices.
