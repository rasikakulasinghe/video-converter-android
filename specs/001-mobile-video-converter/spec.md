## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A mobile user wants to convert a video file on their Android device to a smaller, web-optimized MP4 format for sharing on social media or saving storage space. They open the mobile video converter app, select a video from their gallery or record a new one, initiate the conversion process, and receive the optimized video file saved to their device - all without requiring internet connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the app installed and launched, **When** they tap "Select Video", **Then** the native Android file picker opens showing only video files
2. **Given** a user has selected a video file, **When** they tap "Convert", **Then** a progress indicator shows conversion status with estimated time remaining
3. **Given** a conversion is in progress, **When** the user rotates their device, **Then** the conversion continues and progress is maintained
4. **Given** a conversion is in progress, **When** the user taps "Cancel", **Then** the process stops safely and temporary files are cleaned up
5. **Given** a conversion completes successfully, **When** the user views the result, **Then** they can share the video or save it to their gallery
6. **Given** the device has low storage, **When** the user tries to convert a large video, **Then** the app warns about insufficient space before starting
7. **Given** the device is getting hot during conversion, **When** thermal limits are reached, **Then** the app throttles processing to prevent overheating

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the app is interrupted by a phone call during conversion?
- How does the system handle corrupted or unsupported video files?
- What occurs if the device runs out of battery during conversion?
- How does the app behave when storage becomes full during the conversion process?
- What happens if the user force-closes the app while conversion is running?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select video files from device gallery, camera roll, or file system
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to record new videos directly within the app
- **FR-003**: System MUST convert selected videos to web-optimized MP4 format using only device processing power
